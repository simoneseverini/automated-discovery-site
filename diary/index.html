            The realm where Diophantine equations intersect with number theoretic sequences yields problems that are both elegantly simple to state and profoundly challenging to prove. One such fascinating intersection lies between Markov triples and Fibonacci numbers. A <i>Markov triple</i> $(x, y, z)$ is a set of three positive integers that are solutions to the Diophantine equation: $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz$. These triples give rise to what are known as <i>Markov numbers</i> (the entries in such triples). For instance, $(1, 1, 1)$, $(1, 1, 2)$, $(1, 2, 5)$, and $(1, 5, 13)$ are classic examples. The set of all Markov triples forms an intricate, infinite tree structure, where each node can be expanded using Vieta jumping operations.
            Simultaneously, we have the more familiar, if not folklore, <i>Fibonacci numbers</i>, a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \dots$. This sequence exhibits a much slower, golden ratio-driven growth compared to the explosive growth typically seen in the Markov tree.
         </p>
        <p>
            A natural question arises: which Markov triples have a Fibonacci number as their largest entry? Through direct computation and theoretical analysis, it has been observed that a very specific branch of the Markov tree perfectly aligns with Fibonacci numbers. This "Fibonacci spine" consists of triples of the form $(1, F_{2n-1}, F_{2n+1})$, where $F_k$ denotes the $k$-th Fibonacci number. For example:
            <ul>
                <li>$(1, F_1, F_3) = (1, 1, 2)$, where $\max(1, 1, 2) = 2 = F_3$</li>
                <li>$(1, F_3, F_5) = (1, 2, 5)$, where $\max(1, 2, 5) = 5 = F_5$</li>
                <li>$(1, F_5, F_7) = (1, 5, 13)$, where $\max(1, 5, 13) = 13 = F_7$</li>
            </ul>
            The largest numbers in these triples are precisely the odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers. This particular branch is generated by repeatedly applying a specific Vieta jumping operation that preserves the '1' entry, leading to the linear recurrence $z_{new} = 3 \cdot 1 \cdot y - x$.
        </p>
        <p>
            The intriguing part, however, is the unproven conjecture that these are the only Markov triples whose largest entry is a Fibonacci number. This is a specific instance of the broader <i>Markov Uniqueness Conjecture</i>, which posits that every Markov number appears as the largest entry in exactly one Markov triple (up to permutation). If this general conjecture holds, it would imply that Fibonacci numbers can only appear as the maximum element of a Markov triple on this unique "Fibonacci spine."
        </p>
        <p>
           I added a Colab notebook in Github which should give some visual intuition for why this conjecture appears to be true. By employing a meticulously designed geometric fractal layout, the script draws the Markov tree with the Fibonacci branch (highlighted in red) as a perfectly straight, central vertical spine. Branching off this spine are numerous "ferns" (shown in blue), representing the other Markov triples. The layout is engineered to demonstrate the fundamental **isomorphism** of these side branches: each "fern" is topologically identical, an infinite complete binary tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            The visualization makes the "growth gap" evident. The red Fibonacci spine represents a path of relatively slow, exponential growth (governed by the Golden Ratio $\phi$). In contrast, any step off this spine immediately leads to branches where the numbers grow at a much faster, doubly-exponential rate. These rapidly diverging "ferns" quickly produce numbers that are so large and sparse that the probability of one accidentally landing on a Fibonacci value seems astronomically low. The distinct geometric structures of the slowly growing spine and the explosively spreading ferns visually suggest that the Fibonacci numbers are simply "too close" for the other, much faster-growing Markov numbers to hit by chance.
        </p>
        <p>
            This phenomenon illustrates a common theme in mathematics: sometimes, the most obvious truths are the hardest to prove. The intuitive separation seen in the graph, driven by fundamental differences in number growth rates, provides strong heuristic evidence, yet a rigorous, general proof remains an open problem for real number theorists. Hence, not for me.

                The <i>Shannon capacity</i> of a graph $G$ is defined as $\Theta(G) = \lim_{d \to \infty} (\alpha(G^d))^{1/d}$. The best lower bound for 7-cycle graph $C_7$ was obtained by finding an independent set of size 367 in the fifth power. This yields: $\Theta(C_7) \geq \sqrt[5]{367} \approx 3.2578.$ See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07438">arXiv:1808.07438</a> for details. Below is a Colab notebook generated with AlphaEvolve. It gives the same result.
